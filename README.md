# *Jeopardy!* Ticket Web Scraper

This Python script implements a web scraper that checks the *Jeopardy!* website to see if tickets to live tapings are available. If tickets are available, the script sends automated text alerts to a list of phone numbers detailing the dates and times that are available to choose from.

The script can be run using the following command

```
./getTickets.py
```

### Note

The script is currently out of date due to a change in the *Jeopardy!* website architecture. An update to the script will arrive once live tapings resume.
